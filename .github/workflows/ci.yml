# Basic CI Workflow Example
name: CI Pipeline

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build-and-test"
  build-and-test:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Example step - in a real project this would do actual work
      - name: Set up environment
        run: echo "Setting up environment"
        
      # Example build step
      - name: Build project
        run: |
          echo "Building project..."
          # Here you would run your actual build commands
          echo "Build completed!"
          
      # Example test step
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          echo "Running tests..."
          # Here you would run your actual test commands
          echo "Tests completed!"
          
      # Example reporting step
      - name: Generate reports
        run: |
          echo "Generating reports..."
          # Here you would generate test reports, code coverage reports, etc.
          echo "Reports generated!"
          
      # Example artifact storage step
      - name: Archive build artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build-artifacts
          path: |
            # Here you would list paths to your build artifacts
